# m3h's Advent of Code 2024

See https://adventofcode.com for the challenges

I made an effort to push code that is largely as submitted.
That also means that the code is meant to get me a solution fast, with no focus on ease of reading or speed (unless necessary to get a solution).

For day 24b, you need `dot` in your $PATH (from `graphviz`).

To see 'em in action (assuming you have bash and Python)
```
python -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./day*.py
```
